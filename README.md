# attolic_embedded_classes

Source code from my embedded classes  
Used STM32L-discovery board.

Attolic TrueSTUDIO was used to generate boilerplate. The used setup did alot of initialization of unused peripheral, i learned how things worked by cleaning this. That explains the difference in boiletplate of some of these files.
Example of all the files the thing spat out can be seen in `example_code_structure`.

The comments in my own code are god-awful. Perhaps i'll go back and make them better, but it's neat seeing them in their pure form.

Note: I don't know how dynamic the code generation from TrueSTUDIO was, the classes were about writing the needed code by hand.
